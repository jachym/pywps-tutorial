What is PyWPS
*************
`PyWPS <http://pywps.wald.intevation.org>`_ is implementation of 
`OGC Web Processing Service standard <http://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps>`_ 
It should make life easier for those, who want to interface custom
geospatial calculation to the Internet (or intranet), using now days
standards. 

What is PyWPS not
=================
- PyWPS is no analytical tool or engine. It does not perform any type of
  geospatial calculation. 
- PyWPS is not special XML parser or generator. It does not validate your
  GMLs against given schemas (yet), it does not build GML from Python
  objects.
- It is not complicated. Or, it should not be.
